# Portfolio of Data Science Projects for Stefan Bund
During my degree at University of Michigan I produced these data science projects (Masters in Applied Data Science, MADS). I have also included research I did as principal at [rad disco](http://raddisco.com).

## How Do Seasons Impact Markets? 
A study in asset prices, and tightly correlated behavior between sell volume and pessimistic economic announcements. 
+ [SlideDoc presentation](https://github.com/stefanbund/MADSPortfolio/blob/main/04-Liang-Yau-Bund_2023winter.pptx.pdf)

## Can the United States Decouple from Chinese Exports?
A study on the American dependence on Chinese exports. Proposes margins by which the US Trade Office may negotiate new trade agreements with nations within the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership member nations, per industry sector. 
+ [SlideDoc presentation]
+ [Python notebooks]

## Locating Highly Covariant Commodity Trade Clusters
I used python to discover affine clusters of tradeable commodities, and investigate how a major firm such as Citadel will use affine clusters of financial products to predict pricing. 
+ [SlideDoc presentation]
+ [Python notebooks](https://github.com/stefanbund/MADSPortfolio/blob/main/visualizing%20commodity%20clusters%20--%20bund.ipynb)

## Heartrate Efficiency Curves and Holistic Fitness Devices
I investigated how the implementation of various fitness devices accompanied improved workout efficiency, as measured through workout intensity and heart rate graphs. Used during an introduction to data visualization course with Chris Brooks.
